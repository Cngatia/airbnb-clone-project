🛠️ Technology Stack
This project leverages a modern and scalable technology stack to ensure performance, maintainability, and ease of development:

⚙️ Django
A high-level Python web framework used for building the backend of the application. It handles routing, business logic, and serves as the foundation for building RESTful APIs and managing user authentication.

🐘 PostgreSQL
An advanced open-source relational database system used to store and manage structured data securely and efficiently. It integrates seamlessly with Django through the ORM.

🌐 GraphQL
A query language for APIs used to allow flexible and efficient data retrieval. It gives frontend developers more control over the data they request, reducing the number of API calls.

🎨 HTML/CSS/JavaScript
The core technologies for building the frontend structure, styles, and interactivity of the application’s user interface.


🐳 Docker
Used to containerize the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

🧪 Pytest
A testing framework used to write and run unit and integration tests for Django components to ensure reliability and maintainability.


🗂️ Database Design
The database is designed to support the core functionalities of the Airbnb-like platform, including user management, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payments. Below are the key entities and their relationships:

A user can make multiple bookings

A user can write multiple reviews

🏠 Properties
Represents listings created by hosts.

Key Fields:

id: Primary key

title: Name of the property

description: Detailed info about the property

location: Address or coordinates

price_per_night: Cost of booking per night

Relationships:

A property belongs to a user (host)

A property can have many bookings

A property can receive many reviews

📅 Bookings
Tracks reservation details made by users.

Key Fields:

id: Primary key

user_id: Foreign key referencing the guest

property_id: Foreign key referencing the booked property

start_date: Check-in date

end_date: Check-out date

Relationships:

A booking belongs to one user (guest)

A booking is for one property

A booking can be linked to one payment

📝 Reviews
Captures user feedback on properties.

Key Fields:

id: Primary key

user_id: Foreign key referencing the reviewer

property_id: Foreign key referencing the reviewed property

rating: Numeric rating (e.g., 1–5 stars)

comment: Optional text feedback

Relationships:

A review is written by a user

A review belongs to a property

A user can write multiple reviews for different properties

💳 Payments
Handles transaction information for bookings.

Key Fields:

id: Primary key

booking_id: Foreign key referencing the booking

amount: Total payment made

payment_method: Type (e.g., card, PayPal)

status: Payment status (e.g., completed, pending)

Relationships:

A payment is linked to one booking

A booking has one payment

This schema ensures clean data organization, referential integrity, and supports all major features of the application.

✨ Feature Breakdown
This project replicates the core functionality of a vacation rental platform, allowing users to list, browse, book, and review properties. Below is a breakdown of the main features and how they contribute to the overall user experience:

👤 User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. It supports both guests and hosts, enabling authentication, authorization, and role-based access to features like property listings and bookings.

🏠 Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings, including adding details such as location, description, images, and pricing. This feature ensures that listings are dynamic and reflect real-time availability.

📅 Booking System
Enables guests to view available properties and make reservations by selecting dates and confirming payments. It prevents double bookings and allows users to view and manage their booking history.

💳 Payment Integration
Handles secure payment processing for bookings. It calculates the total cost based on stay duration and ensures smooth transactions using mock or real payment gateways (depending on implementation).

📝 Reviews & Ratings
Guests can leave feedback on their stays, helping future users make informed decisions. Hosts can use this input to improve their listings and services.

🔍 Search & Filters
Users can search for properties by location, date, price range, and other filters. This improves the user experience by helping users quickly find suitable listings.



🔒 API Security
Securing the API is a critical aspect of this project, especially given the sensitivity of user data, booking records, and payment details. Below are the key security measures implemented to protect the platform:

🔐 Authentication
The system uses token-based authentication (e.g., JWT or Django Token Auth) to ensure that only registered users can access protected endpoints. This helps prevent unauthorized access and ensures session integrity.

Why it matters:
Authentication safeguards personal data, user sessions, and platform resources from unauthorized use or identity spoofing.

✅ Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced to differentiate between guests and hosts. Certain actions, like listing properties or managing bookings, are restricted based on user roles and ownership.

Why it matters:
Authorization ensures that users can only access or modify resources they own or are permitted to interact with, reducing misuse and data leakage.

🚦 Rate Limiting
API requests are throttled using rate limiting techniques (e.g., via Django REST Framework throttling) to prevent abuse such as brute-force login attempts or DDoS-style request floods.

Why it matters:
Rate limiting protects the API from performance degradation and potential exploitation by malicious actors.

🔒 Data Encryption
All communication between clients and the server is encrypted using HTTPS (SSL/TLS). Sensitive fields like passwords are hashed using secure algorithms like bcrypt.

Why it matters:
Encryption ensures that sensitive user information, including login credentials and payment data, cannot be intercepted or tampered with during transmission.

🛡️ Input Validation & Error Handling
Strict input validation and sanitized responses are implemented to prevent common attacks like SQL Injection, XSS, and information leakage.

Why it matters:
Proper validation and handling protect the application from malicious payloads and maintain platform integrity and stability.

Security is a continuous process. As the project scales, additional measures such as audit logging, anomaly detection, and third-party penetration testing may be introduced to further harden the system.


🚀 CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) are essential practices in modern software development that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. CI/CD pipelines help detect bugs early, ensure consistent builds, and speed up release cycles.

For this project, the CI/CD pipeline ensures that every change pushed to the repository is automatically tested and, if successful, deployed to the staging or production environment.

🛠️ Tools Used:
GitHub Actions: Automates testing, linting, and deployment workflows directly from the GitHub repository.

Docker: Containerizes the application to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and deployment.

Docker Compose: Orchestrates multi-service application setups during testing and development.

Heroku / AWS / Render (optional): Can be used as deployment targets depending on infrastructure requirements.

🔁 Pipeline Stages:
Code Checkout – Triggered on every push or pull request.

Build – The application and services are built using Docker.

Test – Automated tests are run to validate the codebase.

Lint & Format – Code style and standards are checked.

Deploy – If all checks pass, the app is deployed to the staging or production environment.

This setup improves reliability, encourages frequent updates, and ensures code quality throughout the development lifecycle.
